problem: "This was the first project I had full reign over the website structure, via a sitemap. The homepage, mobile version and landing page were also wireframed for the first time in my new role as Web Developer & UX Specialist. \r\n\nThe main focus of the redesign was to bring the design up to date, create SEO friendly pages that Google could crawl better, and making landing pages that convert for PPC campaigns."

solution: "I first started with the sitemap, to lay a groundwork of pages for our team. The sitemap wasn't complex in the first place, so it didn't change drastically. However, I did some work to make the URL slugs have better breadcrumb-like properties.\n\nThe previous iteration of the website didn’t have a lot of visual cues, which was a weakness in terms of navigating the site. Since this was a truly visual product, a user should be able to tell what the product was before visiting it’s page. I made the windows and doors a big part of the navigation - literally. The thumbnail sized images in the drop down navigation showcase the product - allowing the user to quickly recognize what type of window they are looking for, without needing to reference the name. \r\n\nMaking the main goal of the website (filling the the quote form) quicker and less prone to user error. The final design and website has a number slider for the amount of windows and doors the customer needs a quote on, which was not in the final prototype, but was present in an earlier one. \r\n\nSome features I decided to scroll into view using aos.js. I used this to capture a user's attention to various elements, but I tried not to overdo it.\n\nOn the development end, I used various optimization tools such as WP Rocket's Lazy Loading, and a WebP image converter to make sure the images weren't slowing down the website. I also coded in a way to allow quick modifications to the landing pages. Going forward, we will implement A/B testing on our campaigns to see what page and form changes are the most effective at conversions, using a mix of CrazyEgg heatmapping and Analytics."
