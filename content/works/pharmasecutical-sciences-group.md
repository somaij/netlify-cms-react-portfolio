  I refer to this project as the magnum opus of my time spent at napkin
  marketing. The Pharmaceutical Sciences Group required a website to do the
  following:


  * Have a subscription based membership system

  * Allow members to purchase tickets at different prices, depending on the
  membership level.

  * Allow members to watch past video webinars

  * Have a members only job board

  * Use WordPress

      When I first started my role at napkin marketing, I did some cursory
      research into the possibilities of what solutions I could conjure up. I
      created a matrix to weigh the pros and cons, then discussed it with the
      team. Once I had a concrete idea of what could be accomplished, I created
      a wireframe that portrayed the numerous set of actions a user could take.
      From the initial sign up to registering for an event, as well as other
      actions a member would be able to take.

      Another UX Designer had started the sitemap and homepage, and I took over
      to handle the inner pages with my knowledge on how the S2 Member Pro and
      Event Espresso plugins would work.

  Once the prototype was finalized, I worked closely with the designer and the
  outsourced front-end developers so that I could focus on the back-end
  development. S2Member is a membership plugin that accepts and automates
  reccuring payments through PayPal. The plugin also allows the administrator to
  block off certain parts of the website. To handle the events, I decided on
  Event Espresso because of its add-on plugin which allows Event Espresso to
  limit the sale of tickets to the appropriate S2Member membership level. It
  also had convenient features like mass emailing attendees and automated
  accounting features.
