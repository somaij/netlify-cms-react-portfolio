problem: "I refer to this project as the magnum opus of my time spent at napkin marketing. The PSG required a website to do the following:\r\n\n* Have a subscription based membership system\r\n* Allow members to purchase tickets at different prices, depending on the membership level.\r\n* Allow members to watch past video webinars\r\n* Have a members only job board\r\n* Use WordPress"

solution: "When I first started my role at napkin marketing, I did some cursory research into the possibilities of what solutions I could conjure up. I created a matrix to weigh the pros and cons, then discussed it with the team. Once I had a concrete idea of what could be accomplished, I created a wireframe that portrayed the numerous set of actions a user could take. From the initial sign up to registering for an event, as well as other actions a member would be able to take.\r\n\nOnce the prototype was finalized, I worked closely with the designer and the outsourced front-end developers so that I could focus on the back-end development. S2Member is a membership plugin that accepts and automates reccuring payments through PayPal. The plugin also allows the administrator to block off certain parts of the website. To handle the events, I decided on Event Espresso because of its add-on plugin which allows Event Espresso to limit the sale of tickets to the appropriate S2Member membership level. It also had convenient features like mass emailing attendees and automated accounting features."
