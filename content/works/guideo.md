  An inconvenient commute. This was my 5 week project for the User Experience
  course at Brainstation.

problem: >-
  During the 5 weeks at Brainstation, our class was given the assignment to
  create a transit app. It was left up to us to find a problem, and solve it
  with the mental and digital tools learned in class. 


  A problem I decided to solve was something I saw recurring in my user
  interviews - when GPS guidance is provided, the user was usually stuck on one
  route without any flexibility. The users that I had interviewed were prone to
  walking when it was an option, for economic and health reasons. 


  There was also the issue of transit delays. Apparently, delays are not clearly
  communicated and are sometimes are severe enough to the point of walking being
  faster.

  **Project Deliverables**


  All of the following deliverables can be found in the [project's final
  presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KPjkYIp0fYH7nr_9wNvH9ghLr2fq919R9YWtwUM6rik/edit?usp=sharing).


  * 4 User Interviews

  * Information Architecture

  * 2 Personas

  * 2 User Flows & Sets of Sketches

  * Wireframe


  The solution, as with most projects, went from not defined at all to very well
  defined. The first assumption as the problem during the course of this
  assignment was not the one I had ended with. It taught me the value connecting
  the dots during the user research phase, and to never be locked down to one
  idea or vision. 


  I used Waze and Google Maps as the main user interface inspiration. All of the
  users I interviewed were very familiar with them, and I wanted to use
  conventional, industry standard guidelines. Every second counts when trying to
  get somewhere. 


  The differentiating factors of Guideo were three things:


  1. A faster way to identify alternative routes, and modify specific parts of a
  route with walking.

  2. Pricing information is readily available, and it notifies if a route is
  presto only.

  3. It will notify and provide alternative **walking **routes when there is a
  delay.


  I came away from the course with a greater understand of how to produce a
  better user experience. I learned how to throw away my ego when being
  critiqued. How to stay silent and provide not provide answers during user
  testing. When and how to prod for knowledge the interviewee thought was common
  sense.


  Industry professionals Gerard Dolan and David Aboutboul taught the class
  invaluable life and career lessons, and I hope to carry a design thinking
  approach to everything that I do henceforth.
