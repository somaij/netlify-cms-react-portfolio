  An inconvenient commute. This was my 5 week project for the User Experience
  course at Brainstation.

  During the 5 weeks at Brainstation, our class was given the assignment to
  create a transit app. It was left up to us to find a transit problem, and
  solve it with the skills and digital tools learned in class. 


  I decided to focus on public transit. The common pain points found during user
  interviews were:


  1. It sucked to do transfers due to delays and misinformation.

  2. Navigation apps would only provide a set of immutable routes. Users
  couldn't change parts of a route, so that they could walk halfway instead of
  using a streetcar.

  3. Detailed information such as a route being presto only or pricing
  information wasn't easily found.

  4. Uber was expensive, and Uber Pool didn't prioritize getting users there on
  time.


  Surprisingly, users didn't mind walking 20 minutes if they didn't need to take
  another streetcar or bus.

  **Project Deliverables**


  All of the following deliverables can be found in the [project's final
  presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KPjkYIp0fYH7nr_9wNvH9ghLr2fq919R9YWtwUM6rik/edit?usp=sharing).


  * 4 User Interviews

  * Information Architecture

  * 2 Personas

  * 2 User Flows & Sets of Sketches

  * Wireframe


  The solution, as with most projects, went from not defined at all to very well
  defined. The first assumption as the problem during the course of this
  assignment was not the one I had ended with. It taught me the value connecting
  the dots during the user research phase, and to never be locked down to one
  idea or vision. 


  Waze and Google Maps were the main user interface inspiration. All of the
  users I interviewed were very familiar with them, and I wanted to use
  conventional, industry standard guidelines. Every second counts when trying to
  get somewhere, so recognition is key.


  The differentiating factors of Guideo were three things:


  1. A faster way to identify alternative routes, and modify specific parts of a
  route with walking.

  2. Pricing information is readily available, and it notifies if a route is
  presto only.

  3. It will notify and provide alternative **walking **routes when there is a
  delay.


  The [full
  wireframe](https://app.moqups.com/JSomai/Aln757niFM/view/page/a10d02abc) has 2
  user flows. 


  1. If you click on the **Work button**, you will follow the _User Navigates to
  Work _flow. This one demos how the app handles delays and re-routes.

  2. The _User Navigates to David's Tea _task flow can be started by clicking in
  the **second textbox at the top**, next to the location marker. This flow
  showcases how to modify routes.


  I came away from the course with a greater understand of how to produce a
  better user experience. I learned how to throw away my ego when being
  critiqued. How to stay silent and provide not provide answers during user
  testing. When and how to prod for knowledge the interviewee thought was common
  sense.


  Industry professionals [Gerard
  Dolan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerarddolan/) and [David
  Aboutboul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-aboutboul/) taught our class
  invaluable life and career lessons. I hope to carry a design thinking approach
  to everything that I do henceforth.
