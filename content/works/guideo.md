  [During my 5 weeks at
  Brainstation](https://brainstation.io/course/toronto/user-experience-design),
  our class was given the assignment to create a transit app. It was left up to
  us to find a transit problem, and solve it with the skills and digital tools
  learned in class. For this project we used the [**human centered
  design**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_design) approach which
  included identifying problems in current user experiences by user interviews
  and testing our solutions by having users navigate rough sketches (using the
  [Marvel ](https://marvelapp.com/)app) and low fidelity wireframes (using
  [Moqups](https://moqups.com)).

      The first step in the process was finding out what the problem was in the
      first place! I interviewed 4 people, with this set of questions:


      1. What is your name?

      2. Where do you live? And work?

      3. Describe the last time you walked somewhere.

      4. What apps do you use to navigate?

      5. What makes you walk over using public transit?

      6. What do you wish you could change about the process of navigating
      somewhere?

      7. What information do you wish was readily available?


      I then found some common issues that my interviewees shared:


      1. Transfers were a hassle due to delays and misinformation.

      2. Navigation apps would only provide a set of immutable routes. Users
      couldn't change parts of a route, so that they could walk halfway instead
      of using a streetcar.

      3. Detailed information such as a route being presto only or pricing
      information wasn't easily found.

      4. Uber was expensive, and Uber Pool didn't prioritize getting users there
      on time.


      Surprisingly, none of my interviewees didn't mind walking 20 minutes if
      they didn't need to take another streetcar or bus.

      Using the information I gathered, I created two personas to embody the two
      user flows I was working towards.

  **Project Deliverables**


  All of the following deliverables can be found in the presentation above.


  * 4 User Interviews

  * Information Architecture

  * 2 Personas

  * 2 User Flows & Sets of Sketches

  * Wireframe


  The solution, as with most projects, went from not defined at all to very well
  defined. The first assumption as the problem during the course of this
  assignment was not the one I had ended with. It taught me the value connecting
  the dots during the user research phase, and to never be locked down to one
  idea or vision. 


  Waze and Google Maps were the main user interface inspiration. All of the
  users I interviewed were very familiar with them, and I wanted to use
  conventional, industry standard guidelines. Every second counts when trying to
  get somewhere, so recognition is key.


  The differentiating factors of Guideo were three things:


  1. A faster way to identify alternative routes, and modify specific parts of a
  route with walking.

  2. Pricing information is readily available, and it notifies if a route is
  presto only.

  3. It will notify and provide alternative **walking **routes when there is a
  delay.


  The [full
  wireframe](https://app.moqups.com/JSomai/Aln757niFM/view/page/a10d02abc) has 2
  user flows. 


  1. If you click on the **Work button**, you will follow the **User Navigates
  to Work flow**. This one demos how the app handles delays and re-routes.

  2. The **User Navigates to David's Tea task flow** can be started by clicking
  in the **second textbox at the top**, next to the location marker. This flow
  showcases how to modify routes.


  I came away from the course with a greater understand of how to produce a
  better user experience. I learned how to throw away my ego when being
  critiqued. How to stay silent and provide not provide answers during user
  testing. When and how to prod for knowledge the interviewee thought was common
  sense.


  Industry professionals [Gerard
  Dolan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerarddolan/) and [David
  Aboutboul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-aboutboul/) taught our class
  invaluable life and career lessons. I hope to carry a design thinking approach
  to everything that I do henceforth.
