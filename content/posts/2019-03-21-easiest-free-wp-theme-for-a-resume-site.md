## Why Do I Need a Website?

It astounds me - the number of tech people that I've met and they don't have a website. When I was in college doing Systems' Analyst and even later when I was in university doing **IT**, a majority of my peers didn't have a website to show who they really were to potential employers. I'm proud to admit I managed to convince a couple of techy and design pals to create their own online presence. 

But what about non-tech people? [Here's a 2013 Forbes article on why everyone needs a website](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/04/26/why-every-job-seeker-should-have-a-personal-website-and-what-it-should-include/#3bcb0dea119e). 

Okay, I'll stop preaching and assume you're on board by now. 

## The Theme

Your first instinct is probably to gravitate to this thing you've heard about - **WordPress**. It's a great, easy to use platform. Originally made for blogging, but you can keep it super simple. If you're on a free hosting plan like x10hosting, you're probably not going to get any theme pack-ins with your WordPress install. 

For the past couple of weeks I've been searching for a free theme to set up my cousin's website. I didn't want to put in a lot of work (he had a whopping budget of $0!), but the free stuff I came across were pretty outdated. Until I came across Colorlib's theme - [**Shapely**](https://colorlib.com/wp/themes/shapely/). I was in love with the shape of it. 

It has a simple set up wizard that guides you through installing it's required plugins. I'm not a fan of page builders, but this one was bearable because it uses built in WordPress features to get the job done, decreasing the bloat. The [demo](https://colorlib.com/shapely/) is a good showcase of it's capabilities. Personally, I just used the parallax banner with a free stock image, and the contact form 7 widget. 

For his resume, I used a Word to HTML online converter, and pasted it into a regular page. You can also just use the regular editor and paste it in straight from Word - I just wanted to refine the design a bit.

After that, I just simply linked the resume page in the menu. There's also a feature to create a social media menu that automatically creates icons for you in the footer. [Here's a link to the very helpful documentation](https://colorlib.com/wp/support/shapely/). 

[This was how his site turned out](http://chrissomai.x10host.com/). Pretty great for the amount of time put in.

## Recommended Plugins

Oh, and before you go, here's a list of plugins I think are **essential**. They're all free so don't worry!

* [Yoast SEO](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) - You need to control how your search results show up on Google. It's important!
* [WP Smush](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/) - Decreases image size automatically. Smaller images = faster site.
* [Wordfence](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/) - The bad thing about WordPress is that when left unchecked it becomes open to vulnerabilites. But Wordfence should help with that.
